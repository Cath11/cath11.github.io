                I work with a wide variety of industry partners 
                to help them make better use of their data and, 
                in turn, better business decisions. From data literacy, visualisation, analytics, 
                interpretation and communication I am here to help 
                with all your business analytics needs. <br>

            just for those employees with "data" in their job title. All employees at all levels 
            need to be data literate. Improved data literacy is needed to 
            make better sense of the huge volumes of data available 
            to organisations and consequently to make better data-driven business 
            decisions to enable business success.<br>

                    <strong>DATA AWARE/ACCESS</strong><br>
                   The early stages of data literacy involve understanding the role of data and then 
                   how identify and use data appropriately. Questions to consider:
                    What data are you collecting? What data should you be collecting? 
                    How are you planning to use this data? 
                    What business problems are you looking to resolve?  </div>

                    <br>
                    <strong>ENGAGE/MANAGE</strong><br>
                    Subsequent stages of data literacy involve evaluating, analysing and interpreting data and findings
                    for the purpose of decision making. Discover the hidden patterns in your data. Make comparisons between groups. 
                    Data visualisation is essential to translate data into information. Questions to consider:
                    What comparisons are useful to solve the business problem?
                    What are we expecting form the data?
                    What are the relationships in our data?
                    What does the broader evidence tell us in terms of benchmarking and research evidence?</div>

                    <strong>COMMUNICATE</strong><br>
                    This stage of data literacy requires synthesising, 
                    visualising and representing the data. Here it is important to ensure the data and findings are 
                    linked with business decisions and actions. 
                    Questions to consider: How are the findings linked to business deicisions?
                    How are insights linked with the business problem? What are the 
                    blockers for change? What would the change look like? How can we measure/determine 
                    whether the change is successful? More data...   </div>
