            <div class="flexbox-item flex-box-item-2"> With over 20 years of business analytics experience, 
                I work with a wide variety of industry partners 
                to help them make better use of their data and, 
                in turn, better business decisions. From data literacy, visualisation, analytics, 
                interpretation and communication I am here to help 
                with all your business analytics needs. <br>

                <strong>Let's work together to make better data-driven decisions! </strong></div>

                Data literacy is the ability to collect, 
                process, and extract meaning from data, 
                and in doing so, convert data to actionable 
                insights. Improved data literacy is needed to 
                make better sense of the huge volumes of data available 
                to organisations and consequently to make better data-driven business 
                decisions to enable business success.

                    <strong>DATA</strong><br>
                    Data type and quality is important. Decisions need to be based on sound data 
                    otherwise it's a "garbage-in, garbage out" situation.  Questions to consider:
                    What data are you collecting? What data should you be collecting? 
                    What business problems are you looking to resolve?  </div>

                    <br>
                    <strong>INSIGHT </strong><br>
                    Discover the hidden patterns in your data. Make comparisons between groups. 
                    Data visualisation is essential to translate data into information. Questions to consider:
                    What comparisons are useful to solve the business problem?
                    What are we expecting form the data?
                    What are the relationships in our data?
                    What does the broader evidence tell us in terms of benchmarking and research evidence?</div>

                    <strong>ACTION </strong><br>
                    Don't let all that hard work in terms of data collection and 
                    data visualisation go to waste. Make sure it is linked with business decisions and actions. 
                    Questions to consider: How are insights linked with the business problem? What are the 
                    blockers for change? What would the change look like? How can we measure/determine 
                    whether the change is successful? More data...   </div>
